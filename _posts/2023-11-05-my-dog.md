When I was 9 years old my family adopted my adorable dog Carlos. He's a golden doodle (black because his mother was a black poodle) and he's 14 at the time I'm writing this. He loves walks in Magnuson Dog Park in North Seattle right on Lake Washington and spending time with his people. Here are some cute photos of him!
