## Education

### B.S. Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science Emphasis
<strong>UCLA Samueli School of Engineering 2023</strong>
<p>I am graduating from UCLA's Samueli School of Engineering this December 2023! I chose to get my degree in Biomedical Engineering because of my interest in the rapidly growing field of biotechnology. While I primarily have focused my coursework around data science and software engineering, I have taken a wide breadth of classes on other subjects involving drug design/chemical engineering as well as robotics.</p>

## Work Experience

### Research Associate/AI Software Engineer
<strong>Cedars-Sinai Hospital Medical Imaging (Los Angeles)</strong>
<p>In my senior year at UCLA I cooperated with the <abbr title="Biomedical Imaging Research Institute">BIRI</abbr> at Cedars-Sinai Hospital to put together our capstone project. For this project I led a team of 6 other UCLA engineers to refine a U-Net <abbr title="Deep Learning">DL</abbr> model used to segment abdominal CT Scans. We then used those segmented images along with a separate <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> model to create an automated workflow for identifying patients with CT scans that showed possible signs of <abbr title="Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (Pancreatic Cancer)">PDAC</abbr>. After we presented this project to the Biomedical Engineering Board at UCLA, the group at Cedars-Sinai asked me to join their team as an intern. Since then, they have promoted me to the position of Research Associate as I continue to work on developing and training ML/DL models and publish written research.</p>

### Startup Backend Software Engineer
<strong>Lintbook Homeowner Expense Application</strong>
<p>Recently I worked with a startup app project intended to help homeowners track their spending on house projects/purchases. As a backend engineer, I set up a workflow using AWS services that allows app subscribers to forward their invoices to an email inbox, and use computer vision to automatically extract data from the invoice and create a receipt in the app for the user. Part of the code used for data extraction was also used to extract data from files directly uploaded to the app in a very similar manner.</p>

### Software Engineer
<strong>UCLA <abbr title="Biomedical Engineering Society">BMES</abbr> Design Team</strong>
<p>During my junior year at UCLA I worked with a group of 9 other engineers from UCLA’s Biomedical Engineering Society to develop a prototype therapeutic glove to aid in Parkinson’s rehabilitation. We used React Native to design an IOS app that worked in tandem with Arduino-controlled glove sensors. These sensors gathered data from hand movements made by the subject and tracked tremors and possibly involuntary movements.</p>

### Back of House Staff
<strong>Vinbero Wine Bar</strong>
<p>The summer after my sophomore year at UCLA, I worked at a wine bar in Edmonds, WA. Here I prepped food, and did regular lunch and dinner service 5 days/week. Nothing makes you appreciate the wonderful food service workers like walking a mile in their shoes, so I am extremely grateful for my time here.</p>

### Teaching Aide 
<strong>University of Washington -- MATH 120</strong>
<p>In my junior year my math teacher at Roosevelt High School (who also teaches summer courses at UW) asked me if I would come be her TA for the summer. This was my first real job, and an extremely rewarding one at that. I graded and recorded assignments for classes of 60+ students, and assisted professor in organising lectures and accompanying coursework as well as providing out of class office hours for students in need of extra help.</p>
